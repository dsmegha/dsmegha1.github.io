	<p class="intro">I am Megha, a software Engineer by education, an adventurer at heart and a traveler by passion. </p>
	<p>Wind in my hair is my personal blog. The name reflects what I love. Anything that gets some wind in my hair, from cycling to standing on a hill, from driving to bungee jumping, I love anything that involves some adventure. However my true interest still remains software, and I am trying to learn a lot of how websites work from this site. Join me on my adventures, I will make sure they are fun!</p>
