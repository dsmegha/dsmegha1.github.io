It was August 2013. I had been working in the software industry for networking giants like Cisco and Juniper for almost 4 years then. I had a great job, many people's dream job. I wrote some good code and earned some good money. But there was something amiss. I went ahead with my yearly trip to the mountains, this time a 2 week trip to the remote valley of Lahaual and Spiti, Himachal Pradesh. The trip not mind opening, gave me a lot of time to think about what I want and where I wanted my career to ahead. By the time I was back in India's silicon valley, Bangalore certain things were clear. I did not want to get back to software job I had. Don't get me confused, I still loved writing software. It was one of the things I enjoyed and I was good at, but it just wasn't enough. I realised that the everyday commute would drain me out. I still remember getting into traffic the first day after I got back from my trip and thinking, life cannot be just this. I would spend about 1.5 hours one way to get to office everyday. That meant I was spending 15 hours every week just getting to office and back home. I could rent a place nearby, but that meant I was living in a not so great locality, and my social life would get shattered. Being born and brought up in Mysore, a quiet town, I was longing to get back hometown. I finally quit my job at Juniper networks and moved back to my hometown. I joined a travel startup and travelled for months in Karnataka, Kerala and Goa and developed a solid product for the company. As I wrap up my part in the company, I have the question in my mind, what next? I know deep down, that I want to get back to software and work on some great products. But I also know for sure I do not want to move back to the chaos that Bangalore is
